>
> :three: `Example03` use controller api with basic authentication based on authorisation filters (applied globally)
>
> :four: `Example04` use minimal api with basic authentication based on endpoint filters (applied globally)
>
> :five: `Example05` use controller api with basic authentication based on authorisation filters (applied by route)
>
> :six: `Example06` use minimal api with basic authentication based on endpoint filters (applied by route)
